# finding_occurence_probability.cpp
The input to the given C++ code is read from inp.txt data file which contains the no. of LFSRs, length &amp; initial state of each LFSR(considered as the secret key here) which would be derived later on exploiting the information given by the correlation attack.The developed C++ code computes the occurrence probability of each LFSR state in the output sequence (and the no. of LFSR bits matched with 10000 keystream bits). It also computes the period of each LFSR.Apart from this, 5 output data files namely: lfsr_seq1.txt, lfsr_seq2.txt, lfsr_seq3.txt, lfsr_seq4.txt &amp; key_seq.txt, each containing 10000 bits are also generated.
